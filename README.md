This application should be used to style the basic syncfusion components.

For that you can create you own Syncfusion theme here:
https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/appearance/theme-studio/

After downloading the created theme, you can replace the content of 'syncfusion-theme.css' with you css file data.
If you want to add additional theme files, you have to reference them in angular.json file in the 'styles' section.
